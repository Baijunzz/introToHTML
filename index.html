        <h2>What is HTML and its role?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML is a coding language that helps us create the structure of a web
          page easily
        </p>
        <h2>Why use Semantic HTML elements vs dics?</h2>
        <p>
          With sementics, our code becomes more readable and we'll also be able
          to tell what is supposed to be what rather than having to look at 20
          divs in a row and guess what they mean
        </p>
        <h2>Why learn HTML?</h2>
        <p>It's fun and a useful language to know!</p>
